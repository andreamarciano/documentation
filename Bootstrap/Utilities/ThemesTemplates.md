## ✅ Official Examples

The official --[Bootstrap Examples](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/examples/)-- page offers dozens of prebuilt templates for different use cases:

- ✅ Responsive --landing pages--
- ✅ Layouts with --offcanvas-- and --sticky headers--
- ✅ Admin-style --dashboards--
- ✅ Forms with validation
- ✅ Pricing pages, sign-in forms, and more

---

## Starters

Use these templates to kickstart your Bootstrap project with modern tooling:

- **Vite + Bootstrap**
- **Webpack**, **Create React App**, and more
- Include minimal setup with Bootstrap + JS bundlers
- Ideal for integrating with React, Vue, or other frameworks

> These setups use ESM imports and custom bundlers instead of including Bootstrap via CDN.

## 🧱 UI Snippets

Quick layout building blocks (pure HTML + Bootstrap classes). Useful for copy-paste into your project.

Some of the most useful: **Headers**, **Heroes**, **Sidebars**, **Footers**, **Cards**, **Grids**, **Breadcrumbs**, **Modals**, ...

Each snippet shows best practices with spacing, responsiveness, and modern Bootstrap classes.

## 🎛️ Custom Components

Larger UI templates that simulate entire sections or pages of real apps. Great for learning layout strategies or reusing in your own app.

Some highlights:

| Template        | Description                                    |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| 🖼️ **Album**   | Responsive photo album/grid layout             |
| 💳 **Pricing**  | Plans, cards, CTAs — great for SaaS or landing |
| 🛒 **Checkout** | Full form with validation and payment sections |
| 📰 **Blog**     | Posts layout with sidebars, pagination, etc.   |
| 🧾 **Invoices** | Printable invoice template                     |

> ✅ Each is built with **vanilla Bootstrap**, fully responsive and HTML-only — no JS frameworks required.

## 🧰 Framework Tools

Templates that focus on learning and using the Bootstrap framework itself:

- 📐 **Grid Template**: responsive layout with columns, gutters, and breakpoints
- 🧾 **Starter Template**: super minimal HTML page with CDN
- 📚 **Cheatsheet**: interactive documentation of all utility classes (available offline)

## 📌 Navbar Examples

Bootstrap offers multiple navigation layout variants as templates:

| Variant                 | Description                               |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| 📌 **Static Top**       | Default top navbar                        |
| 📌 **Fixed Top**        | Stays visible on scroll (`.fixed-top`)    |
| 📌 **Sticky Top**       | Sticks only when scrolling down           |
| 📌 **Bottom Navbar**    | Docked navbar at bottom (`.fixed-bottom`) |
| 📌 **Offcanvas Navbar** | Mobile-style sidebar nav                  |

## 🛠️ How to Use an Example

Bootstrap examples are designed to be flexible starting points. Here are some common ways to use them:

- **Download and customize**
  You can download the full HTML/CSS/JS files and modify them to fit your project’s needs. This is great if you want a ready-made layout quickly.

- **Use as reference**
  Study the code to learn how Bootstrap classes and components are structured. Copy snippets or layout patterns into your own project.

- **Embed parts**
  Copy individual components (e.g., navbar, hero section, footer) into your app without importing the entire template.

- **Integrate with frameworks**
  Adapt the examples to your preferred stack (React, Vue, Angular) by converting static HTML into components.
